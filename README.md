# Corvistore

## About

Corvistore is a client/server oriented backup solution written in PHP. Yep, got that right.

It was originally intended to be a learner project, a way to fill six free weeks with something meaningful such as checking out whether I would be capable to pull this off.

In its current state, the project is nowhere near being ready. It is in a basic working state in a way that multiple nodes can be defined and data can be backed up and restored. Performance is bad. Very bad. Security is ok considering the connection (SSL), but with passwords stored as cleartext.
