Sure, here is a simple Podmanfile that uses CentOS 8 as a base and installs php-cli and composer:

```Dockerfile
# Use CentOS 8 as the base image
FROM centos:8

# Update the system
RUN yum -y update

# Install PHP CLI
RUN yum -y install php-cli

# Install Composer
RUN curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer

# Verify that php and composer are installed
RUN php -v && composer --version
```

You can build and run this Podman container using the following commands:

```bash
podman build -t my-php-app .
podman run -it my-php-app
```

This will create a new container image named `my-php-app` and then run it in an interactive terminal. The `php -v` and `composer --version` commands at the end of the Podmanfile will output the installed versions of PHP and Composer when the container is run. Please replace `my-php-app` with your preferred image name. Remember to run these commands in the directory where your Podmanfile is located.
